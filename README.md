# halofilinScripts

''' 
Author: John Mallon

This repository contains the custom python scripts written for our halofilin paper. Included scripts are:

1. A python script that converts the gaussian curvature data into RGB color values called "gaussianColormapCreation.py"
2. A python script used in the software Blender to color a cell's surface with the RBG values from script #1
3. A python script that maps gaussian curvature data of a cell's surface to the fluorescent signal of halofilins at the membrane

All scripts were written with python version 3.8
